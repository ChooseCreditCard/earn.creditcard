      <h1>How Cards Earn Points, Miles &amp; Cashback</h1>

        Earn.creditcard explains the “earn side” of rewards — how every unit of spend turns into points,
        miles or cashback, what defines a good earn-rate, and how to align your cards with the way you
        actually spend money.

    <!-- What is earn-rate? -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What does “earn” mean in card rewards?</h2>
      <p class="small">
        In credit-card rewards, “earn” describes how much value you get back from each unit of spend:
        how many points, miles or % cashback you accumulate when you pay with your card.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Base earn-rate</strong> – the standard rate on most purchases (e.g. 1 point per unit of currency).</li>
        <li><strong>Bonus categories</strong> – higher earn-rates on specific categories like travel, groceries or dining.</li>
        <li><strong>Promotional earn</strong> – temporary boosts on certain partners, channels or campaigns.</li>
        <li><strong>Tier multipliers</strong> – higher earn-rates unlocked through status levels or premium cards.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        A strong earn-rate does not automatically mean a good deal. You also need to look at how those
        points can be used, and what they are realistically worth when redeemed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How earning works -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How earning points, miles &amp; cashback actually works</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Behind the scenes, card rewards are funded by interchange, fees and partner economics. The earn
        mechanics are designed to guide behaviour:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Transaction → reward engine</strong> – each authorised transaction is categorised
          (MCC, channel, currency) and matched to an earn-rule.</li>
        <li><strong>Points / miles posting</strong> – rewards are calculated and posted to your balance,
          either instantly or in batch (daily/statement).</li>
        <li><strong>Category mapping</strong> – merchants are mapped to categories; incorrect mapping can
          affect which earn-rate you get.</li>
        <li><strong>Caps &amp; thresholds</strong> – some earn structures reduce rates above certain spend
          levels or stop awarding beyond a cap.</li>
        <li><strong>Breakage &amp; expiry</strong> – unused points or miles that expire are part of the
          issuer’s economic model.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Understanding these mechanics helps you spot when a “high earn-rate” headline does not match the
        real value you receive over a full year of spending.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Types / models of earn structures -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common earn structures on reward cards</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Different card types use very different earn patterns. Matching your spend mix to the right model
        matters more than chasing the largest number on the brochure.
      </p>

      <div class="cluster-grid">
        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Flat earn-rate cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Same earn-rate on almost all purchases, e.g. 1–2% cashback or 1 point per unit of currency.
            Simple and predictable, ideal if your spending is spread across many categories.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Category bonus cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Higher earn-rates on specific categories (travel, dining, groceries, fuel) and lower on
            everything else. Powerful if your spend is concentrated in those categories.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Rotating or activatable bonuses</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Quarterly or monthly categories with boosted earn, often requiring manual activation.
            Great value if you keep track — mediocre if you forget to opt in.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Partner &amp; co-brand earn</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Extra-high earn when spending with specific airlines, hotels, merchants or platforms, with
            lower rewards elsewhere. Best for loyal customers of those ecosystems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Tier &amp; status-based earn</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Earn multipliers that scale with your status or premium card tier. Often combined with high
            annual fees and strong travel or lifestyle perks.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Hybrid earn models</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Mix of flat earn, category bonuses and partner earn. Flexible for complex spending patterns,
            but harder to evaluate without doing the maths.
