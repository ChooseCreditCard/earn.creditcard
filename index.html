          Credit cards promise “points on everything”, “double miles” and “5% back”.
          This page explains how earning actually works in practice – base rates, bonus
          categories, welcome bonuses, caps and devaluations – so you can judge offers
          without marketing noise.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does It Mean to “Earn” With a Card?</h2>
      <p>
        When a card advertises rewards, it is promising to return part of the interchange
        and interest it collects back to you as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>cashback in your statement or bank account</li>
        <li>points in a bank rewards ecosystem</li>
        <li>miles or points in an airline or hotel program</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The “earn rate” – for example 1 point per unit of currency – is only part of the story.
        The real value depends on how you redeem, whether you hit caps, and how stable the
        program is over time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>Base Rate, Bonuses and Promotions</h2>
      <p>
        Most cards split earning into three layers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Base earning</strong> – a flat rate on all eligible purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Category bonuses</strong> – higher earn rates on travel, dining, groceries or fuel.</li>
        <li><strong>Promotional boosts</strong> – welcome bonuses, limited-time multipliers or partner campaigns.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Welcome bonuses typically require you to spend a fixed amount in the first few months.
        These can look attractive in headline form, but you should check:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>required spend vs your normal budget</li>
        <li>whether fees and interest wipe out the reward value</li>
        <li>if the bonus is paid in a currency you can use effectively</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Categories & caps -->
    <section id="categories" class="section">
      <h2>Bonus Categories, Caps and Fine Print</h2>
      <p>
        High earn rates often apply only in specific merchant categories, defined by codes
        (MCC – merchant category codes) that do not always match how you personally think
        about a purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common details to check:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Which MCC codes</strong> are included for “travel”, “dining” or “groceries”.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly or annual caps</strong> on bonus earning in each category.</li>
        <li><strong>Tiered structures</strong> where spend above a threshold earns less.</li>
        <li><strong>Exclusions</strong> such as government payments, gift cards or wallet top-ups.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A card that advertises “5x” in a narrow category with low caps may earn less overall
        than a simple, uncapped flat-rate card – depending on your real-world spending pattern.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Value & risks -->
    <section id="value" class="section">
      <h2>From Earn Rate to Real-World Value</h2>
      <p>
        To understand whether you are really “earning”, think in three steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Estimate how much you spend in each category per year.</li>
        <li>Apply the earn rates and caps to see how many points/miles/cashback you will receive.</li>
        <li>Estimate realistic redemption value per point or mile – not the best-case scenario.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You should also consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual fee</strong> – does your expected earning clearly exceed it?</li>
        <li><strong>FX fees and spreads</strong> when using the card abroad.</li>
        <li><strong>Devaluation risk</strong> – programs can change award charts or cashback terms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you often carry a balance, interest costs can quickly outweigh any rewards – in that
        case, the effective “earn rate” becomes negative.
