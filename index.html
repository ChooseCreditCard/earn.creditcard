    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does “Earn Rate” Mean on a Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>The earn rate is how many points, miles or cash-back units you receive per unit of currency spent. A card might give 1 point per dollar on general purchases and higher multipliers—such as 3x or 5x—for specific categories like travel, dining or groceries.</p>
      <p>Marketing usually highlights the biggest number, but most spending may post at the lower base rate. Understanding how much of your budget actually falls into bonus categories is key to estimating total yearly rewards.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Transactions Turn into Points, Miles or Cash</h2>
      <p>When a transaction posts to your account, the issuer classifies the merchant using a category code. That code determines which earn rate applies: base, bonus category, or sometimes a promotional rate for a limited time period.</p>
      <p>Rewards are then calculated according to the card’s rules—rounded up, rounded down or pooled monthly—and added to your rewards balance. Some programs post rewards immediately, while others update on the statement date.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Welcome Bonuses, Multipliers and Caps</h2>
      <p>Welcome offers often promise a lump sum of points if you spend a certain amount in the first few months. These bonuses can be valuable but they are one-time; the long-term value of a card depends more on the ongoing earn structure than on the initial headline.</p>
      <p>Many bonus categories also have caps, such as “3x on groceries up to a yearly limit” or “extra miles on fuel up to a monthly ceiling.” Once you hit the cap, earnings drop back to the base rate, which can change the math for heavy spenders.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Points, Miles or Cash-Back: What Are You Really Earning?</h2>
      <p>Cash-back is straightforward: each unit has a predictable cash value, although redemption rules may still impose minimums or timelines. Points and miles can be more flexible but also more complex, with values that depend on how and when you redeem.</p>
      <p>Two cards with the same earn rate can deliver very different real value if one program offers strong transfer partners or premium redemptions and the other has weak options or frequent devaluations.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Fees, Interest and Net Reward Value</h2>
      <p>Annual fees, foreign transaction fees and interest charges can quickly erase the benefit of a high earn rate. If you carry a balance, the cost of interest usually outweighs any reward you earn on new purchases.</p>
      <p>When comparing cards, it helps to estimate net rewards: total yearly earnings minus annual fees and any extra costs driven by the card’s structure. The “best” earn rate is the one that stays positive after all of those factors are considered.</p>
